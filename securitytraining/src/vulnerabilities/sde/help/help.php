                        <p>IT systems usually save in a database user's personal information
                            such as passwords, credit card numbers, house address,
                            telephone number, id number etc.

                            When the system is not protected effectively from unauthorised
                            access there is a high probability that a hacker might exploit
                            that vulnerability and steal that information. That
                            vulnerability is "Insufficient Cryptographic Storage".</p>
